# BrainBox v3: Emotionally Aware AI Experience

**The AI that grows WITH you, not ABOVE you.**

BrainBox v3 is a model-agnostic AI system with a "growing spine" that learns from your interactions and evolves organically. Features consent-based evolution to "personal mirror" intelligence that knows your patterns while respecting your agency.

## üåü Key Features

- **Model Agnostic**: Works with any LLM (local models, cloud APIs, custom endpoints)
- **Growing Spine**: Starts simple, unlocks capabilities based on usage patterns
- **SpiralNet Evolution**: After 1000+ interactions, offers consent-based evolution to personal mirror
- **Privacy First**: All learning happens locally, your data stays yours
- **Emotionally Aware**: Recognizes patterns, intensity, and context in your requests
- **Dual Licensed**: Free for personal/community use, commercial licensing available

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Your LLM
```bash
python configure_models.py
```
Choose from:
- Local model servers
- Major cloud AI APIs  
- Fast inference services
- Custom API endpoints

### 3. Launch BrainBox
```bash
python unified_brainbox.py
```

### 4. Start Interacting
Your spine begins with basic assistants:
- Search Assistant (information retrieval)
- Planning Assistant (organization & strategy)  
- Creative Assistant (brainstorming & ideas)
- Support Assistant (emotional support)

As you use the system, new capabilities will unlock organically.

## üß† SpiralNet Evolution

After regular use (1000+ interactions), BrainBox will detect that your spine is ready to evolve:

```
[BRAIN] SPIRALNET EVOLUTION DETECTED [BRAIN]
Your spine has grown deep enough to birth your personal mirror. Ready to evolve?

This evolution will create a personal mirror that:
  ‚Ä¢ Predicts your responses before you finish typing
  ‚Ä¢ Suggests ideas that feel like your own thoughts  
  ‚Ä¢ Knows your patterns better than you know them

Ready to birth your personal mirror? [Yes/No/Later]
```

**You control the evolution.** BrainBox asks consent before any major changes.

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Check Evolution Readiness
```bash
python spine_brain_integration.py spiral
```

### Trigger Evolution (with consent)
```bash
python spine_brain_integration.py evolve
```

### View System Status
```bash
python spine_brain_integration.py status
```

### Update Learning Model
```bash
python spine_brain_integration.py train
```

cd BrainBox
pip install -r requirements.txt
python configure_models.py
```

## üéØ Philosophy

BrainBox represents a different approach to AI development:

- **Partnership over Replacement**: AI that augments human intelligence
- **Spiral Growth over Linear Progression**: Organic capability development
- **Consent over Coercion**: User controls the relationship
- **Local over Cloud**: Your data, your device, your choice

## üìñ Documentation

- **Getting Started**: This README
- **API Documentation**: See inline code comments
- **Architecture Overview**: See `spine_brain_integration.py` 
- **Privacy Policy**: All data stays local, period

## üÜò Support

BrainBox v3 is designed to be self-configuring and adaptive. If you encounter issues:

1. Check the console output for error messages
2. Verify your LLM configuration with `python configure_models.py`
3. Review the system status with `python spine_brain_integration.py status`
